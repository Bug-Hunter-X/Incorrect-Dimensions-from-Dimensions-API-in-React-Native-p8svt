This React Native bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API to get screen dimensions within a component that is rendered before the layout is completely calculated.  This can lead to incorrect dimensions being returned, causing elements to be positioned incorrectly or rendered improperly.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
import { Dimensions, View } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ width: width / 2, height: height / 2 }}/>
  );
};
```
